## HW1 > simple shell
- using frok, exec, wait to implement a simple shell
- usage: <porgram> <arg1> <arg2> ......
- also done I/O redirection and pipeline

## HW2 > Shared memory
- multi-process matrix multiplication
- basic parallel processing
- input is the dimension of two square matrics A and B
- A x B = C
- output is execution time and checksum
- matrics A,B and C are stored in a shared memory
- using shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl
