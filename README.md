# 2017-Fall-Operate-System

## HW1 > simple shell
- using frok, exec, wait to implement a simple shell
- also done I/O redirection and pipeline

## HW2 > Shared memory
- multi-process matrix multiplication
- basic parallel processing
- input is the dimension of two square matrics A and B
- A x B = C
- output is execution time and checksum
- matrics A,B and C are stored in a shared memory
- using shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl

## HW3 > Pthread
- parallel quicksort with pthread
- using pthread, semaphore

## HW4 > Thread Pool
- quicksort with a tread pool
- using semaphore to control threads
- master thread signals a sleeping thread to work when new task comes in

## HW5 > Page Cache Simulation
- implementing FIFO and LRU

## HW6 > A File Find Utility
- implement a subnet of the "find" command
- finding files by name, inode, and file size
- recursively descending into sub-directories to find all matches

## HW7 > File Fragmentation and Reproduction
